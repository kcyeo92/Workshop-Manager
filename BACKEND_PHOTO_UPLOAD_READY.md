# Backend Photo Upload - Implementation Complete âœ…

## What's Been Done

### 1. Installed Dependencies
- `googleapis` - Google APIs client library
- `multer` & `@types/multer` - File upload handling

### 2. Created Files
- `/backend/src/services/googleDrive.ts` - Google Drive service with Service Account
- `/backend/src/controllers/photosController.ts` - Photo upload/retrieval controllers
- `/backend/src/routes/photosRoutes.ts` - Photo API routes
- Updated `/backend/src/routes.ts` - Registered photo routes

### 3. API Endpoints Created
- `POST /api/photos/upload` - Upload photos (multipart/form-data)
- `GET /api/photos?customer=X&plateNumber=Y` - Get photos for a task
- `GET /api/photos/:fileId` - Get photo content (acts as proxy)

### 4. Security
- Updated `.gitignore` to prevent service account key from being committed
- Configured multer with 10MB max file size limit
- Only accepts image files

## Next Steps

### YOU NEED TO DO:
1. Follow `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SETUP.md` to create service account
2. Download the JSON key file
3. Place it in `/backend/service-account-key.json`
4. Add to `/backend/.env`:
   ```
   GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=your_folder_id_here
   GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH=./service-account-key.json
   ```
5. Share your Google Drive folder with the service account email

### THEN I WILL:
- Update frontend to use new backend API instead of direct Google Drive
- Remove OAuth requirements from frontend
- Test the complete flow

## How It Works

1. User uploads photos via frontend
2. Frontend sends photos to backend API
3. Backend authenticates with YOUR Google Drive using Service Account
4. Backend uploads to folder structure: `Workshop Photos/yyyy/mm/customer_plateNumber/`
5. All users' photos go to YOUR Drive, regardless of who uploads
